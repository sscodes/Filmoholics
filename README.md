# Filmoholics

A website for cinephiles and movie lovers to store their watchlist, and rate their watched movies, which also recommends movies based on their past views and ratings and peer views and ratings.

The front end is made using HTML CSS JS, Bootstrap and slick js plugin. The backend of the website is still in process. Thus it is not ready to be used yet. Although you can go ahead and check the design and front end of the website and share your feedback! 

The recommendation system is made by [Soham Das](https://github.com/So-ham).
